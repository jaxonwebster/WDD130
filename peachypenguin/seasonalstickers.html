        <h2>Seasonal Stickers</h2>
        <p>These stickers are for the people that put up their Christmas tree before Thanksgiving, or go above and beyond with their Halloween costume. This is an added way to celebrate life and get excited about the time of year! The seasonal pack is just what the name implies, stickers for every season! Prepare to get spooky, merry, and thankful all at the same time with these seasonal stickers! These are best used as holiday gifts, stocking stuffers! They are also best used to decorate Christmas cards, folders, phone cases, water bottles, or laptops! Stickers emphasize that something is particularly important to YOU! With that said, what is most important to you? If it is spending time with your loved ones during the holiday season, you have come to the right place.</p>
